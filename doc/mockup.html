    <h1>Design Mockup for Views</h1>
    <p>This document contains a mockup of each view that I consider necessary for Spoodle, except for the views that consist of just a form. <br>
    Colours are not final!</p>
    <h3>Welcome view</h3>
    <img src="welcome.jpg"/>
    <p>This view greats all visitors that are not logged in. It contains a carousel with some fancy images and a list of features that Spoodle offers. The aim is to get visitors to click on the link that takes them to the register form.</p>
    <h3>Home view</h3>
    <img src="home.jpg"/>
    <p>This view is default page for logged in users. It contains a list of all events, split into separate tabs for each possible state an event can have. Only one tab is shown at a time, the others are hidden.</p>
    <h3>Event views</h3>
    <h4>Invitation</h4>
    <img src="event_invitation.jpg"/>
    <p>Inivitations are events that the user has been inivted to but where he has NOT YET selected his available dates.</p>
    <h4>Upcoming, variable Date</h4>
    <img src="event_var_date.jpg"/>
    <p>The difference between this and the invitation is that the user has already selected his available dates but the date of the event itself has not yet been finalized.</p>
    <h4>Upcoming, fixed Date</h4>
    <img src="event_fix_date.jpg"/>
    <p>Here there is afinal date when the event will take place (but it's in the future so it isn't passed yet).</p>
    <h4>Passed</h4>
    <img src="event_passed.jpg"/>
    <p>This is the view for events that have passed. The organizer of an event has the ability to add some data (like duration, distance, GPS positions, ...) to the database and visualise this data in the passed event view.</p>
    <h3>Friends view</h3>
    <img src="friends.jpg"/>
    <p>This view is where all friends of a user are listed and where he can reach a link to search for users (by name, email, ...) to add more friends.</p>
    <h3>Statistics view</h3>
    <img src="stats.jpg"/>
    <p>This view displays aggregated statistics (per day, week, month, year) about data (like distance, duration, ...) of all the events the user has taken part. </p>
